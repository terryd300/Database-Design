# Database Design
 Group Project in Designing a Database

This was a group project for my database design class that entailed going through the initial steps of designing a database.  Tasks included determining an appropriate entity that would benefit from a database, determining what tasks a database would handle and then completing the initial design and layout of the database.  The final database was not created and there was no coding involved
